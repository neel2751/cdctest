This stage will typically last for about 7 working days. It is advisable for you to give us your comments as well as request for alterations whether or not you are satisfied, as further progress will not be made until you are satisfied. Your designs will be made to your needs since the whole reason we came up with this in the first place is because you wanted to be happy and satisfied with the results. To enhance this process further, we also have 3D models which for an easier visualization of the final work. This advancement makes the decision-making process easier and ensures that the final design is in line with one's requirements.",

Detailed Quotation Our estimators will prepare a detailed quotation based on your designs and specifications. This includes a comprehensive schedule of works which allows you to see what’s included within it. Together with you, we will go through and adjust the quote so that it meets your expectations budget-wise and otherwise. Party Wall Agreements If work to be effected is near the shared boundary, a party wall agreement may be necessary. We can recommend trusted surveyors to assist with this process. We recommend you to speak to your neighbors about your plans early on in the process in order to avoid delays. Project Schedule One of the most important aspects for a build to be successful is it to have a detailed project schedule. When the quotation is accepted, we will be able to complete a timetabled plan which shows key milestones such as planned delivery of major items, kitchens and glazing, as well as the project completion date. This guarantees everything is done appropriately and on time. Agreement and Payment We will make sure that beforehand both you as the client and us as the contractor have a formal agreement or a contract which serves as protection to both parties once the construction work is ready to commence. This contract complies with the industry norms and captures all the necessary details agreed upon. To reserve the start date for our construction team, a deposit of 5% will be required.",
